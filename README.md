# Contao Supertext Translation

AI translation for [Contao](https://contao.org) 5.7 and 6.0 by [Supertext](https://www.supertext.com). Adds a **Translate with Supertext** action to the site structure: pick a page (or a whole website root) and the languages, and the bundle copies the pages with their articles and content elements into the other language roots and translates the texts. New pages are created unpublished for review; translating again updates them in place.

```bash
composer require supertext/contao-supertext-translation
```

You need a Supertext account ([create one](https://www.supertext.com/person/en/account/signin)) and an API key ([supertext.com → Integrations → API](https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api), requires the Admin role); set it as `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY` (see the [Installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md#api-key)).

Formatting, links and insert tags are kept; translated pages are linked for the language switcher (terminal42/contao-changelanguage); previous versions stay restorable.

**Live demo:** <https://contao-production.up.railway.app/contao> (credentials from the Supertext team)
